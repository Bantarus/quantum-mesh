Explanation:
LRU Cache: We use the LruCache from the lru crate to store compressed states. The cache is wrapped in a Mutex to ensure thread safety when accessed concurrently.
Cache Initialization: The cache is initialized with a specified capacity, which determines how many compressed states it can hold before evicting the least recently used ones.
Cache Access Methods: We provide methods to get a compressed state from the cache and to add a new compressed state to the cache.
Usage in Compression: In the compress_state method, we first check if the compressed state is already cached. If it is, we return it directly. Otherwise, we perform the compression, cache the result, and then return it.
This caching mechanism will help improve the performance of your system by reducing redundant computations for frequently accessed states. You can adjust the cache capacity based on your application's needs and available resources.

This implementation adds several key improvements to the tessellation generation:
Adaptive Density: The tessellation density adapts based on the path length and local curvature of the hyperbolic space.
Efficient Coverage: Uses a grid-based approach to track covered areas and avoid redundant tessellation.
Optimized Point Distribution: Generates points in concentric layers with proper hyperbolic spacing.
Point Optimization: Removes redundant points while maintaining coverage.
Proper Hyperbolic Coordinates: Uses correct hyperbolic polar-to-cartesian conversion with Möbius transformations.
The key improvements are:
More efficient memory usage by avoiding redundant tessellation points
Better coverage of the hyperbolic space through adaptive density
Improved numerical stability through proper coordinate transformations
Reduced computational complexity by tracking covered areas
